I’m an Assistant Professor in the Methodology and Statistics department at Utrecht University. My research focuses mainly on Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM). I am especially interested in developing methods for regularized Bayesian SEM, in which we use shrinkage priors to automatically obtain flexible and more realistic models. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in (regularized) Bayesian SEM or related topics!

Previously, I was a PhD-student at Tilburg University. My project [“Advancing structural equation modeling with unbiased Bayesian methods”](https://www.nwo.nl/projecten) was supported by an NWO Research Talent grant.
