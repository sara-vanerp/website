My primary professional interests are in Bayesian Statistics (more specifically in Bayesian Hypothesis Testing), Psychometrics, R programming and Machine Learning or, even better, some combination of the four! I am a fan of a "common ground" approach regarding the polarization of Statistics in the form of *"Frequentist vs Bayesian"* (even though Centrism, in general, isn't my cup of tea, I believe it might work when it comes to Statistics). You can see more of what I do on my GitHub profile or you can also read my CV. Feel free to contact me with any questions you might have regarding my research/work or if you are interested in future collaboration. I am open for consultations, teaching or just having a fun chat about statistics and data!
