## Workshops
In 2022, I gave a workshop on Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling during the conference [SEM: New Developments and Applications](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/socialsciences/organization/departments/methodology-statistics/events/structural-equation-modeling). Materials for this workshop are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sara-vanerp/BSEMworkshop).

## Courses
I have taught work groups in various methodology and statistics courses since 2012, first as student-assistant and later as a PhD candidate. As Assistant Professor at Utrecht University, I have (co-)coordinated and taught in various methodology and statistics courses, including the Bayesian summer school course for which I developed [new materials](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/BayesianEstimation/).

## Supervision

### 2024-Current
#### PhD-Student Florian van Leeuwen  
I am co-promotor and daily supervisor of *Florian van Leeuwen* on the project: "Getting the best predictions from complex data sets: Balancing scalability and interpretability". The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between the scalability of predictive modeling techniques and their interpretability by combining rigorous statistical methods with innovative machine learning approaches.

### 2022-Current
#### PhD-Student Sanne Appels
I am co-promotor and daily supervisor of *Sanne Appels* on the interdisciplinary [Road to Resilience](https://wil.sites.uu.nl/home/) project. The goal of this project is to uncover protective factors and compensatory mechanisms behind resilient trajectories in atypical literacy acquisition using Bayesian (regularized) SEM.

### 2022
#### Research Master Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural Biomedical and Social Sciences
- *Michael Koch*. Getting a Step Ahead: Using the Regularized Horseshoe Prior to Select Cross-Loadings in Bayesian CFA. All code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JMBKoch/1vs2StepBayesianRegSEM).

### 2021
#### Master Applied Data Science
- *Ylias Ben Salah*. A Comparison between Bayesian penalized regression priors: Lasso and regularized horseshoe.

- *Rashied Amir*. The key differences between the classic and Bayesian LASSO: Comparing shrinkage and variable selection properties in regression problems.
